 === Introduction ===
 
   A few months ago a new rover was sent to McMurdo Station in the Antarctic. The rover is a technical marvel
   as it is equipped with the latest scientific sensors and analyzers capable of surviving the harsh climate of the
   South Pole.  The goal is for the rover to reach a series of test sites and perform scientific sampling and analysis.
   Due to the extreme conditions, the rover will be air dropped via parachute into the test area.  The good news is
   the surface is smooth and free from any type of obstacles, the bad news is the surface is entirely ice which may 
   introduce noise into your rovers movements.  The station scientists are ready to deploy the new rover, but first 
   we need to create and test the planning software that will be used on board to ensure it can complete it's goals.

   The assignment is broken up into two parts.

   Part A:
        Create a SLAM implementation to process a series of landmark (beacon) measurements and movement updates.

        Hint: A planner with an unknown number of motions works well with an online version of SLAM.

    Part B:
        Here you will create the planner for the rover.  The rover does unfortunately has a series of limitations:

        - Start position
          - The rover will land somewhere within range of at least 3 or more beacon for measurements.

        - Measurements
          - Measurements will come from beacons and test sites within range of the rover's antenna horizon.
            * The format is {'landmark id':{'distance':0.0, 'bearing':0.0, 'type':'beacon'}, ...}
          - Satellites and test sites will always return a measurement if in range.

        - Movements
          - Action: 'move 1.570963 1.0'
            * The rover will turn counterclockwise 90 degrees and then move 1.0
          - stochastic due to the icy surface.
          - if max distance or steering is exceeded, the rover will not move.

        - Samples
          - Provided as list of x and y coordinates, [[0., 0.], [1., -3.5], ...]
          - Action: 'sample'
            * The rover will attempt to take a sample at the current location.
          - A rover can only take a sample once per requested site.
          - The rover must be with 0.25 distance to successfully take a sample.
            * Hint: Be sure to account for floating point limitations
          - The is a 100ms penalty if the robot is requested to sample a site not on the list or if the site has
            previously been sampled.
          - Use sys.stdout = open('stdout.txt', 'w') to directly print data if necessary.         

        The rover will always execute a measurement first, followed by an action.

        The rover will have a time limit of 5 seconds to find and sample all required sites.
