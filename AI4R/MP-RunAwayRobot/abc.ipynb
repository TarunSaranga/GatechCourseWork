    "# Background\n",
    "# \n",
    "# A robotics company named Trax has created a line of small self-driving robots \n",
    "# designed to autonomously traverse desert environments in search of undiscovered\n",
    "# water deposits.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# A Traxbot looks like a small tank. Each one is about half a meter long and drives\n",
    "# on two continuous metal tracks. In order to maneuver itself, a Traxbot can do one\n",
    "# of two things: it can drive in a straight line or it can turn. So to make a \n",
    "# right turn, A Traxbot will drive forward, stop, turn 90 degrees, then continue\n",
    "# driving straight.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# This series of questions involves the recovery of a rogue Traxbot. This bot has \n",
    "# gotten lost somewhere in the desert and is now stuck driving in an almost-circle: it has\n",
    "# been repeatedly driving forward by some step size, stopping, turning a certain \n",
    "# amount, and repeating this process... Luckily, the Traxbot is still sending all\n",
    "# of its sensor data back to headquarters.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# In this project, we will start with a simple version of this problem and \n",
    "# gradually add complexity. By the end, you will have a fully articulated\n",
    "# plan for recovering the lost Traxbot.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# ----------\n",
    "# Part One\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Let's start by thinking about circular motion (well, really it's polygon motion\n",
    "# that is close to circular motion). Assume that Traxbot lives on \n",
    "# an (x, y) coordinate plane and (for now) is sending you PERFECTLY ACCURATE sensor \n",
    "# measurements. \n",
    "#\n",
    "# With a few measurements you should be able to figure out the step size and the \n",
    "# turning angle that Traxbot is moving with.\n",
    "# With these two pieces of information, you should be able to \n",
    "# write a function that can predict Traxbot's next location.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# You can use the robot class that is already written to make your life easier. \n",
    "# You should re-familiarize yourself with this class, since some of the details\n",
    "# have changed. \n",

    "# ----------\n",
    "# YOUR JOB\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Complete the estimate_next_pos function. You will probably want to use\n",
    "# the OTHER variable to keep track of information about the runaway robot.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# ----------\n",
    "# GRADING\n",
    "# \n",
    "# We will make repeated calls to your estimate_next_pos function. After\n",
    "# each call, we will compare your estimated position to the robot's true\n",
    "# position. As soon as you are within 0.01 stepsizes of the true position,\n",
    "# you will be marked correct and we will tell you how many steps it took\n",
    "# before your function successfully located the target bot.\n",
    "\n",
    "# These import steps give you access to libraries which you may (or may\n",
